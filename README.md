# Tic-Tac-Toe
## This is a refactored version of the classic game of Tic Tac Toe, I've cleaned up the code and made more readable.

https://brent-prod.github.io/refactored-tictactoe/

### I've build it using

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
---
### How to play 
Follow classic rules of Tic Tac Toe, three Z or O placed consecutively on either a row column or diagonally wins the game.

---
### Planning 
I've laid out a pseudo-code plan in JS to break down the various steps to take.
Then worked on each one by one

---
### Known Bugs

Cells are still clickable after a player wins.
It's currently not mobile-responsive.

---
### Future features/Wishlist

- A more visually pleasing CSS 

---
### My experience developing the game (Optional)

- Huge learning curve on how to reference innerText to a function
